// *** TEST INSTRUCTIONS ***
// Create the page shown of digital service groups and a list of items that is changed whenever a digital service group is tapped.
// The list items do not need to be tappable for this exercise.
// Use the build in digital services "API" to fetch the required information to build the page.
// Within the API response you can find the images for each icon, as well as all of the properties/labels necessary to complete the page.
// Ask questions as necessary and feel free to look up things on Google.
// Don't worry about perfect styling or finishing the entire exercise before time expires.
